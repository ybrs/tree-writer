tree-writer
===========

draws n-tree in ascii - like a type writer

![Example](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s29/sh/cc4b60bf-2ed1-4f7b-91ac-6f9fca4a816f/9ab692fe87102b8ed679329078482401/res/f63b28d6-63bc-43f0-a240-22ff6d970bb5/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=832)

currently calcs widths as it should but X locations are not 100% correct
